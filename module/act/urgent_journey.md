**Goal**: Get to the distant location to meet with the ally -- quickly!

The characters must meet with a distant ally urgently. They must aquire horses at the
stables, and then move at pace to their destination. However, not all are happy to see
them make this journey, and they may meet resistance.

## Scenes

### 1. The Stables

**Goal**: Acquire horses.

A typical stables complex, with many different beasts - some for sale.

- **Horses** are available for purchase here at standard rates.
- **Hired Thugs** will try to prevent the characters from departing if they purchase
  horses.

If the characters' horses are killed by the thugs, the stablemaster will be sympathetic
but nevertheless charge 150% for replacements, citing a duty of care to his beasts.

### [!] Hired Thugs

These thugs have been hired to ensure the characters do not make the journey in time.
They will attempt to do so through bribery, intimidation, and violence (in that order).
If it looks like the characters will not back down, they will prefer to target their
horses to stall their departure, then flee, rather than fight to the death.

### 2. The Road

**Goal**: Travel the road.

This is a well-kept road within the heartland of kingdom. It cuts through open, pastoral
country.

- A **Time Limit** of 24 hours applies. If the characters do not make this journey
  within this time, it will be too late.
- Standard **Travel Events** occur (i.e. at a minor level on a `4-5/d6` and at a medium
  level on a `6/d6`).

The journey happens to be about a full day's ride at a normal pace. If the characters
are detained for any significant length of time

### 3. The Town

**Goal**: Meet with the ally.

The contact is anxious to meet with the characters, and is expecting them.

- A **Reward** is given to courteous characters who arrive on time: they are reimbursed
  for any expenses (including for the mounts), any wounds are treated, and they are
  given draughts of vitality to ease any exhaustion.

Their contact is a person of influence in this town, and while grateful for the
characters' efforts, they do expect a certain level of due deference.
