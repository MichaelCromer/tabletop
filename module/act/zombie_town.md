# ACT: Zombie Infested Town

| Setting | Enemy   | Theme   |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Urban   | Undead  | Stealth |

**Goal**: Get to the safety of the Stockade at the centre of town.

A town almost completely overrun by zombies. Safety can be found at the Stockade, but
those who attract the attention of the Horde are doomed to join it.

## Scenes

### 1. Outskirts:

**Goal**: Explore the area.

Dirt roads and suburban housing. A few zombies shamble here and there. Scattered
survivors cower in their homes.

- **Loud Noises** attract `1d4` zombines, which arrive from out of sight after a short
  delay. Each time a zombie dies or a new round of combat begins, this effect has a
  `5,6/d6` chance of triggering.
- **Houses** are empty on `1-3/d6`, contain `1d4` zombies on a `4,5/d6`, and
  contain`1d4` survivors on a `6/d6`.

Characters who scout around this area will readily learn the location of the Stockade
and conclude that it is the only secure structure in town. Passing through the centre of
town offers more direct access, but risks attracting the Horde.

### 2. Town Square

**Goal**: Avoid the Horde.

Paved roads and neat blocks of row-houses. The Horde mills around in the centre of town,
a large plaza surrounded by shops and public buildings.

- **Loud Noises** now attract `2d6` zombies and has a `3-6/d6` chance of triggering
  during combat.
- **Houses** now contain no survivors, instead containing `3d4` zombies on a `6/d6`.

It is highly unlikely that characters can enter or traverse the square itself without
attracting the attention of the Horde.

### [!] The Horde

A sluggish but ravenous mass of hundreds and hundreds of zombies, almost the entire
population of the town. Combat is possible, but victory is not.

- **The Horde Approaches** whenever it is sufficiently alerted to potential victims, by
  sight or sound.  Whenever Loud Noises is triggered in Scene 2, the Horde is alerted on
  a `6/d6`. If deprived of victims, the Horde will mill around their last known location
  for `2d6` minutes before dispersing back to the centre of town.

Since there are so many zombies, the Horde is highly vigilant, and will almost certainly
spot any characters. It covers a large area.

### 3. Stockade

**Goal**: Enter the Stockade.

What passes for the town's military fortifications, a short distance from the town
square. It is a large building completely surrounded by a sturdy palisade. The Horde
cannot enter.

- **The Wall** is made of 25ft high spiked logs, with a wooden parapet on the inside
  edge.
- **The Gate** is the single point of ingress, wide enough for a large wagon. It is 20ft
  high and barred from the inside. It faces the town square.

There is no preferential direction for access to the Stockade, as the palisade wall is
well-maintained. The gate, being barred and in full view of the Horde, offers no real
alternative to scaling the wall.
