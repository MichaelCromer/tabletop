**Goal**: Ascend the minaret to disable its grim activity.

A half-spectral spire hovers above a chill lake. It swirls with the spectal forms of the
dead; unhappy souls trapped there by its foul magic. An eerie light shines at its apex.

## Scenes

### 1. The Lake

**Goal**: Reach the minaret.

The lake sits still and black, its surface swirling with chill mist. The spire hangs
suspended above it, its base disappearing into spectral vapour.

- The **Spire Base** is suspended 30ft above the lake surface, and 120ft from shore.
- A **Malevolent Chill** permeates the lake water, and affects any who are submerged
  while within 120ft of the tower. Affected creatures must succeed on a Constitution
  save or suffer disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks for the next
  hour.

### 2. The Ascent

**Goal**: Climb the minaret.

The body of the spire is fashioned of chaotic, twisted metal bands. The ghostly forms of
lost souls flitter through the gaps, their hands reaching and eyes staring.

- The **Main Section** of the tower is no more than 5ft across, and extends 50ft
  vertically. Hand holds are plentiful.
- The **Unhappy Dead** reach to snatch the warmth of the living, dealing cold damage to
  any who climb.

Those who attempt the climb only to fall to the lake below may find that the chill water
makes the next ascent all the harder.

### 3. The Apex

**Goal**: Disable the device

The Apex of the spire is a narrow spike of smooth dark metal, 1ft wide at its base,
narrowing to no more than 6in at its top. An orb of black stone hovers 6in above,
rotating slowly and emitting an unsettling light.

- The **Top Section** is narrow and slippery, and presents a challenge to climbers.
- The **Unhappy Dead** move thickly here, and their whispers cloud the ears. In addition
  to cold damage, they now also deal psychic damage, and affected climbers must make a
  concentration check or slip to the base of the Top Section.

The orb is the source of malevolent necromancy that traps the souls of the dead. It will
not go quietly.

### [!] The Device

An orb of black stone. It fits in the palm of the hand, but few would wish to do this.

- **Lost Souls** will leap from the device into the bodies of any who touch the device
  without first disabling it. Creatures possessed this way will attempt to grapple other
  climbers and toss them to the lake below. 

The orb must be treated with sufficient skill and care before it is safe to remove
manually. Once removed and disconnected from its housing and source of power, it ceases
to function.
