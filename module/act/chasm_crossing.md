| Setting  | Enemy    | Theme    |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Hills    | Draconic | Tactical |

**Goal**: Cross the chasm.

The characters are faced with a precipitous gorge and a narrow bridge that crosses it.
They must make the crossing, but the kobolds who guard the crossing know how to make
full use of their tactical advantage.

## Scenes

### 1. The Ascent

**Goal**: Approach the crossing

The narrow stone path is cut into the face of the near side of this gorge.

- **Kobold Sentries** are posted at strategic locations along the far side of the gorge.
  They are hidden within bowshot and may attemt to pick off any characters who appear to
  be easy targets, but will otherwise wait, merely passing a warning up to the crossing
  guards.

There is little to no cover on the approach, the kobolds having cleared away any such
obscuring terrain. Only a few low thorn bushes dot the trail here and there. It is
highly unlikely that the characters can pass by unseen.

### 2. The Crossing

**Goal**: Cross the bridge

The gorge narrows here, and a natural stone arch bridges its narrowest part.

- The **Near Side** broadens into a ledge about 15ft deep with a slight overhang. It is
  deliberately kept open and clear of debris by the kobolds.
- The **Stone Arch** is 5ft wide and about 40ft long. There are no rails.
- The **Far Side** is a large, 50ft deep ledge. It has a roof-like overhang supported by
  many giant stone pillars. Kobold guards use this terrain as cover.

Kobold defenders will attack the characters in several ways as they attempt to cross.
They are well aware of their tactical advantages, and have had plenty of time to
entrench themselves to make full use of them.

### [!] Crossing Defenders

The kobolds will defend the crossing in a variety of ways:

- **Archer Sentries** will fire on the characters from hidden positions cut in the rocks
  above the crossing.
- **Spellcasters** will wait to fire bolts of lightning down the bridge as soon as any
  character attempts to cross.
- **Melee Units** will rush out in phalanx formation from behind the stone pillars to
  attack any character who makes it to the far side of the bridge. Their numbers are
  hidden due to their positioning. They will attempt to force the characters to the edge
  of the platform.

### 3. The Warrens

**Goal**: Navigate a path away

On the far side, the characters must find the way ahead.

- A **Hidden Entrance**, cleverly disguised by folds in the natural stone, passes
  through a tight cleft in one side of the ledge. Any character larger than a kobold
  will have to squeeze to get through it. It eventually winds back out to a path cut
  into the far face of the gorge, similar to the ascent path.
- A **Large Archway** passes deeper into the rock at the back of the ledge. It leads to
  an antechamber with stairs leading up to the top of the gorge, and down into the
  kobold warrens. This antechamber is trapped with dragon statues that fire lightning.

Characters who linger too long here are likely to come under attack by a large force of
kobolds that rise up to defend the warrens, particularly if they set off the traps in
the antechamber.
