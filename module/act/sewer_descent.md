# ACT: Sewer Descent

| Setting  | Enemy     | Theme        |
|----------|-----------|--------------|

**Goal**: Descend further into the sewers.

The sewers are a dank, dangerous labrynth of tunnels. The characters must find a way
into the depths however they can.

## Scenes

### 1. The First Level

**Goal**: Navigate the sewer tunnels

This tangled warren, where junction follows junction, can easily swallow the unprepared.

- Standard **Travel Events** occur (i.e. at a minor level on a `4-5/d6` and at a medium
  level on a `6/d6`), triggered after each tunnel junction. 
- The **Twisting Tunnels** make any pathfinding very difficult. Forward progress occurs
  only after a minimum of 3 junctions. After this, include the next scenes in the travel
  event options.

This place is a mixture of cramped access corridors, running drains, and cavernous
chambers. There is plenty of opportunity for the unexpected. Access to both the Barge
Inn and the Cistern is possible.

### 2. The Barge Inn

**Goal**: Meet the locals

A shanty of a watering hole for society's dregs, set up on a line of ramshackle barges.

- The **Local Flavour** is a hodge-podge of criminals and vagrants. This is not a place
  of overt violence, but folk here are suspicious and shifty, and not used to social
  pleasantries. If treated favourably, some will share their expertise of the area.
- A **Disgruntled Patron** loiters in the shadows on one bank. He claims he is no longer
  welcome on board, offering a sad story, and offers to pay the characters handsomely if
  they unshackle the lead barge, sending the whole operation into the far depths. He is
  in fact an assassin whose target, a prominent thieves' guild member, is currently in
  the establishment gambling.

A large, swift-moving canal carries sewage away down a tunnel (it shortly joins the
Cistern). Here, a line of barges sit chained together down its length, a transient
home for those down on their luck, and those who prefer to keep out of sight.

### 3. The Cistern

**Goal**: Descend to the lower levels

The cistern drains the sewer water to unknown depths. Access tunnels meet it at various
levels.

- The **Sheer Walls** are slick with slime and virtually impossible to scale.
- The **Access Path** is precarious; the stone sections brittle (damage can cause a
  collapse) and the timber sections half-rotten (excess weight causes collapse).
  Landings punctuate it at regular intervals, and archways lead away into the darkness.
- **Pipe Outlets** dot the walls all over, some small, some enormous. At regular but
  unpredictable intervals, these outlets discharge streams of water. This is prefaced by
  rumbles and gurgles a few moments beforehand, with streams continuing for seconds to
  minutes. Characters might be cut off from one another by a burst, or, if caught
  unawares, may even be knocked into the churning water below.

An enormous stone pit is sunk into the floor of this room. Water thunders into it from
all directions, cascading 60ft or more into the void. A mixture of crumbling stone steps
and precarious timber scaffolding descend into the mist, with landings and archways
leading away at regular intervals. Off to one side of this room, a particularly large
central canal enters through a tunnel, and flickering torchlight may be seen (leads to
the Barge Inn).

### [!] The Watcher

The cistern holds a monstrosity better left undisturbed.

- This **Anonymous Horror** makes is presence known only through its multitude of
  grasping tentacles. It will snatch characters aloft, dash them against the walls, and
  toss them to the waters below, hoping for a feed. It offers little strategy other than
  brute, animalistic force. If sufficiently injured (sufficiently many tentacles are
  severed), it will thrash randomly at the walls, potentially destroying platforms in
  the process.

This monstrous creature will not attack unless the characters reach the lowest level of
the cistern, either through falling in or by getting curious. This enormous being likely
cares little for the injury done to it by the characters, who can at best hope to drive
it off.
