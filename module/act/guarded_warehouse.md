## Scenes

### 1. Approach

**Goal**: Enter the Warehouse.

A large, bare-earth yard surrounds a warehouse building on all sides. Two wooden sentry
towers flank the main approach, a set of rolling double doors on the short wall.

- **Sentry Archers** defend the approach to the front door from the sentry tower. 
- The **Double Doors** are not locked, but are very heavy. There is a winch to open
  them, but takes one minute of winding to open them fully.

Ingress is possible through the main entry, but this is in full view of the sentries.
The storerooms have no windows, but there is a skylight above the main warehouse room.

### 2. Storerooms

**Goal**: Investigate the Storerooms

Multiple locked rooms branch off the central one.

- The **Locks** are well-maintained and secure.
- **Trade Goods** of all kinds fill these rooms.

There is an opportunity to find wealth and supplies here.

### 3. Warehouse

**Goal**: Defeat the guardian.

One large room continues down the length of the building. Here, multiple storerooms
branch off to either side, but the guardians are vigilant.

- **The Guardians** are serious professionals who will brook no nonsense of any kind,
  and will actively move to repulse intruders.
- **The Roof** is high above, and supported by four slender timber posts.

Stealth is an unlikely option here. The roof posts are a potential structural risk.

### [!] The Guardians

One heavily-armed and armoured soldier is supported by a priest. 

- **The Soldier** has heavy armour and a huge greatsword.
- **The Priest** will try mainly to heal the Soldier and will avoid direct
  confrontation.

The Soldier may be goaded in their enthusiasm to damage the roof posts as collateral
damage from their greatsword attacks.
