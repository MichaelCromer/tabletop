## Scenes

### 1. Ashton

**Goal**: Explore the area.
**Act**: [Zombie Infested Town]

Ashton is nestled along the shore of a peaceful lake. Something, however, now darkens
its waters.

- Scouts and rangers on the road to Ashton warn the players about the zombie outbreak.
  They will volunteer information about a previous adventuring party investigating a
  source of magic in the Harbour.
- The **Stockade** building is replaced with the **Harbour**
- Visible from all parts of town is a dark, translucent blur above the lake. This is the
  hidden Tower, completely inaccessible until the magic cloaking it is dispelled.

### 2. The Harbour

**Goal**: Reveal the tower.
**Act**: [Guarded Warehouse]

The Harbour is a defensible strucutre, open only to the water.

A previous adventuring party came here in search of the source of the undead curse, but
fell to its dark magic.

- All **Sentries** and **Defenders** in the Harbour are instead undead versions with the
  same stats.
- The warehouse building is a covered boat slip, which has a clear line of sight out to
  the surface of the lake (and the Tower, if it is visible).
- There are many small craft available to use here.

### [!] The Barrier

Hidden under a tarpaulin in the centre of the Warehouse scene is a large, intricate
magical machine. It projects the magic necessary to keep the Tower hidden and
incorporeal.

- While relatively delicate and easily destroyed by brute force, anything but an
  appropriately careful treatment releases a burst of necrotic energy that damages all
  nearby living creatures. 

### 3. The Tower

**Goal**: Disable the device.
**Act**: [Spirit Minaret]

Summoned here by a necromancer and hidden against prying eyes, this minaret is the
source of the undead plague.

- While the Tower is active, any humanoid that dies within 1 mile of it has its soul
  stolen by the device at its apex, and immediately rises up as a zombie.
