## Utility

### Potion Bandolier (n)

    A stylish leather bandolier. Holds up to n potions in snug sockets. Loading a potion
    in a socket takes an action. Using a potion from a socket takes a bonus action.

### Sunglobe

    A fist-sized sphere of smoked glass. Golden light glimmers within. Smashing it open
    on a hard surface causes a burst of bright light (DC 16 CON save or be blinded for 1
    minute for every creature looking at the point of impact). For 10 minutes
    afterwards, a ball of light remains behind, shedding bright light in a 60ft radius
    and dim light out to 120ft. Creatures in the bright light have disadvantage on
    attack rolls and perception checks while facing the point of light.

### Moonglobe

    A fist-sized sphere of smoked glass. Silver light shimmers within. Smashing it open
    on a hard surface causes a gust of glowing mist that disperses any atmospheric
    effects in a 20ft radius and immediately dispells any enchantments or illusions cast
    at 3rd level or below. For 1 minute afterwards, a ball of light remains at the point
    of impact, shedding dim light in a 20ft radius. Creatures in this radius  have +1 to
    all saving throws for the duration (except aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends, or
    undead, which have a -1 to all saving throws).

### Starglobe

    A fist-sized sphere of smoked glass. Darkness flutters within. Smashing it open on a
    hard surface causes a shower of shimmering sparks of light in a 30ft radius. The
    sparks hang in the air for 1 minute.
